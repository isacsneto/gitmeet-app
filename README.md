# gitmeet-app
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
app made with node.js(backend) and react js(frontend)
its a copy of tinder for developers, you can enter using your github username and match with others devs.
i used github api, express, socket-io, axios and etc...

To make it run locally you need to use the command "yarn dev" inside the service.js folder for the backend
and inside the folder frontend use the command "yarn start", then you need to put your MongoDB credentials in server.js line 17, then you can access http://localhost:3000/.
